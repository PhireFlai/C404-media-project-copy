# Friends API Documentation

## How to Check if Two Users Are Friends
You can determine whether two users are friends by checking if they mutually follow each other.

## Logic for Friendship (Implemented in Backend)
When User B accepts a follow request from User A:

- User A is added to User B's followers.
- The system checks if User A already follows User B.
- If they mutually follow each other, they are added as friends.
- This process is handled in the Accept Follow Request API:
```python
if follow_request.actor.followers.filter(id=follow_request.object.id).exists():
    follow_request.actor.friends.add(follow_request.object)
    follow_request.object.friends.add(follow_request.actor)
```

## Result
- If both users follow each other, they are automatically added to each other's friends list.
- Friends-only posts will now be visible to each other.


## Endpoints

---

## URL: /api/authors/{userId}/friends-posts/
### Method: GET
### Description: Retrieve a list of posts made by users who are mutual friends with the given author.

### When to Use This Endpoint
- Use this endpoint when you need to fetch **only** the posts made by authors who are friends (i.e., mutually connected) with a given user.
- This endpoint is useful when a client application needs to display content that is exclusively shared among friends.

### How to Use This Endpoint
- Send a **GET** request to `/api/authors/{userId}/friends-posts/` with a valid authentication token in the `Authorization` header.

### Why Use This Endpoint
- It filters posts so that only those authored by users who are mutual friends of the specified user are returned.
- This ensures that the user sees posts that are intended to be shared among friends, as opposed to the general public feed.

### Request
- **Method:** `GET`
- **URL:** `/api/authors/{userId}/friends-posts/`
- **Headers:** 
  - `Authorization: Token <your-auth-token>`

### JSON Response Format

- **id:** UUID of the post.
- **author:** An object containing the friend's details:
  - **id:** UUID of the friend.
  - **username:** Friendâ€™s username.
- **title:** Title of the post.
- **content:** Content of the post.
- **visibility:** The visibility level (typically `"friends-only"` for this endpoint).
