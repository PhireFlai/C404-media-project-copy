# URL: /api/authors/feed/

## When the API endpoint should be used
This endpoint should be used when you want to retrieve a personalized feed of posts for the authenticated user. The feed includes:
- The user's own posts (excluding deleted ones).
- Public posts from any author.
- Friends-only posts from mutual friends.
- Unlisted posts from users the authenticated user follows.

## How the API endpoint should be used
Send a **GET** request to `/api/authors/feed/` with a valid authentication token in the `Authorization` header.

## Why the API endpoint should or should not be used
- It should be used to fetch posts tailored to the authenticated user's relationships (friends and followed users).
- It ensures that visibility rules are respected (e.g., friends-only posts are only shown to friends).
- It should not be used to retrieve all posts globally; for that, use the public posts endpoint.

## Example 1: Request
**GET** request to retrieve the userâ€™s feed:

```bash
GET http://nodebbbb/api/authors/feed/
-H "Authorization: Token 993b43e8f2a..."
```

## Example 2: Response
```json
